Description: A simple flask oauth2 provider
        ================================
        
        This project aims to be lightweight (not only) oauth2 provider for flask based
        applications.
        
        Currently it supports:
         - Issuing authorization codes
         - Issuing JWT tokens for password, authorization_code, client_credentials
          grants
           - Out of the box support for refresh tokens
           - No need for storage, token is self contained and it's validity can be
           checked without accessing DB
        
        The project is still in alpha state, API might change a bit in future.
        
        Installation
        =============
        
        Best way is to use *pip*.
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
          pip install Flask-OAuth2-Provider
        
        Make html documentation
        ========================
        
        Doc is "in construction" mode but most of code is documented even with some
        example usage. The general overview how to integrate all this into your
        code is a task to be done.
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
          cd docs
          make html
        
        And then open it as file in you favorite browser. :)
        
        Issues
        =======
        
        Currently there is no way how to revoke tokens and since we use JWT this
        probably will not be fixed.
